# ecobio-redemiatech
The ecobio-redemiatech-core repository serves as the foundational codebase for the EcoBio Redemiatech initiative. It includes essential algorithms, genetic engineering protocols, and synthetic biology tools designed for the development and optimization of genetically engineered microorganisms aimed at environmental remediation. This repository facilitates collaboration among researchers and developers working on pollutant degradation, carbon sequestration, and the integration of microbial solutions into real-world applications.
