# Experimental Protocol 1: Microbial Engineering

## Objective

To engineer microorganisms capable of degrading heavy metals in contaminated soil.

## Materials

- Microbial strains
- CRISPR-Cas9 reagents
- Growth media
- Contaminated soil samples

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**:
   - Isolate microbial strains from contaminated soil.
   - Prepare growth media according to standard protocols.

2. **Gene Editing**:
   - Use CRISPR-Cas9 to introduce genes responsible for heavy metal degradation into the microbial strains.

3. **Culturing**:
   - Culture the engineered strains in growth media for 48 hours.

4. **Testing**:
   - Introduce the cultured strains to contaminated soil samples.
   - Monitor degradation of heavy metals over a specified period.

5. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze soil samplesfor heavy metal concentration before and after treatment using appropriate analytical techniques.

## Safety Considerations

- Always wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling microbial cultures and contaminated materials.
- Dispose of all waste according to local regulations.

## Results

Document the results of the degradation tests, including any observations and measurements taken during the experiment.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings and discuss the effectiveness of the engineered microorganisms in degrading heavy metals.
