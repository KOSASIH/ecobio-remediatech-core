# Experimental Protocol 2: Carbon Sequestration

## Objective

To evaluate the carbon sequestration capabilities of engineered microbial strains.

## Materials

- Engineered microbial strains
- Soil samples
- CO2 measurement equipment
- Growth media

## Procedure

1. **Preparation**:
   - Prepare soil samples in controlled environments.
   - Inoculate soil with engineered microbial strains.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Measure baseline CO2 levels in the soil samples.
   - Monitor CO2 levels at regular intervals using CO2 measurement equipment.

3. **Data Collection**:
   - Record CO2 levels over a specified period to assess the sequestration capabilities of the strains.

4. **Analysis**:
   - Analyze the data to determine the effectiveness of the microbial strains in capturing CO2.

## Safety Considerations

- Ensure proper ventilation when working with CO2 measurement equipment.
- Follow all safety protocols for handling engineered microorganisms.

## Results

Present the data collected during the experiment, including graphs and tables to illustrate CO2 sequestration rates.

## Conclusion

Discuss the implications of the findings for carbon sequestration strategies and future research directions.
